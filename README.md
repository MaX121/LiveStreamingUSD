# LiveStreamingUSD
Python script to manage our Live Streaming project. Manipulating data using python-beautifulsoup 

## UPDATE 18 May 2018
I'm going to fix this project since the previous code is completely messed up and inefficient.
Also replacing file based counter.txt with the MongoDB Database System - NoSQL DBMS which is more effective.
The code will fully rewrite and ported to Python using Flask Web Framework and using Jinja2 for templating engine.
